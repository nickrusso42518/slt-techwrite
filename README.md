## Getting Started
The easiest way to consume this code is to clone it using SSH or HTTPS.

SSH: `git clone git@github.com:nickrusso42518/slt-techwrite.git`

or

HTTPS: `git clone https://github.com/nickrusso42518/slt-techwrite.git`

After cloning, you should see the following file system structure:

```
$ tree --charset=ascii
.
|-- README.md
|-- exercise_1a.txt
`-- exercise_1b.txt
```

These are plaintext files so that they are readable on any kind of computer. You
do not need fancy word processing software, such as Microsoft Word, to
participate. If you don't have any experience with git or GitHub, you can click
the green `<> Code` button, then select "Download ZIP". In your computer's
downloads folder, you will see this repository represented as a `.zip` file.
You can then extract the files to access them individually.
