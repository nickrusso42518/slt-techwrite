Rewrite the paragraphs below, correcting any errors of fact. Reorder sentences into technically-relevant categories, such as application behavior, API, GUI, and network design.

"""
The application source code references a DNS hostname to access the database. This enables the underlying operating system to resolve the IP address dynamically. This design choice has many benefits. Additionally, the database is relational, which is the structure of choice for successful companies like Facebook and Google. Because we intend to instantiate multiple database pods within the Kubernetes deployment, additional customers will consume our new software-as-a-service offering. If we build it, they will come.

The front-end uses Python flask to present both a graphical user interface (GUI) and an application programming interface (API). The GUI uses a blue and orange theme to align with our target demographic. Users can easily add items to their cart and check out in less than one minute. The API uses JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format for its data. Users can also track their orders using voice-activated commands via the GUI. The API response time is typically less than 20 milliseconds, and the GUI plays a "bell" sound once an order has been shipped.

The network that interconnects the application and the users requires high-availability. This removes any single points of failure from the transport path by installing redundant devices and links. The primary path will carry 100% of the traffic load while the alternate path is only used in the event of a primary path failure. This effectively doubles the available bandwidth in the network.

Regarding daily operations, the IT management team will monitor both the software application and the underlying network. Past data shows an inversely proportional correlation between operator notification time and issue manifestation. Said another way, issues are less common when operators pick up the phone sooner.

The individual sentences in this essay are correct, but may exist under the wrong heading. Categorize each sentence into the enumerated heading most related to the sentence. Do not change the names of the headings.

"""
1. Management Design
The network is managed primarily using NETCONF and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). The servers that use these protocols are located in the east coast data center and are secured behind a pair of mutually supporting security appliances. The security appliances operate at layer-3 and exchange IP routes (via OSPF) with the upstream aggregation routers. These devices have an integrated Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) which downloads updated signatures every 15 days in accordance with our Information Assurance (IA) policy. For human driven troubleshooting and advanced analysis, SSH access is also enabled on all devices with read-only access for operators.

2. IP Routing Design
Open Shortest Past First (OSPF) is the routing protocol of choice for the enterprise network. The environment uses a flat OSPF area 0 design on all links for simplicity. NETCONF is used for configuration management and synchronous operational data collection while SNMP transmits event-driven messaging to a central collector (asynchronous). Because this network does not have an out-of-band management network, both NETCONF and SNMP require a stable OSPF topology to perform their function. The Internet edge routers originate default routes for IPv4 and IPv6 to reduce routing table size and speed up network convergence in the campus network.

3. Security Design
The security appliances are connected together using a dedicated cable for high-availability. This ensures that if one device fails, the other continues to operate normally. Because these devices are located in the data center, they are directly connected to the management LAN and thus do not require OSPF routing for device management. OSPF is secured using cryptographic authentication to prevent unauthorized devices from joining the topology. These cryptographic keys are rotated every 180 days; this is an automated process centrally managed using NETCONF.
