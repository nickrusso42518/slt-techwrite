The application source code references a DNS hostname to access the database. This enables the underlying operating system to resolve the IP address dynamically. This design choice has many benefits. Additionally, the database is relational, which is the structure of choice for successful companies like Facebook and Google. Because we intend to instantiate multiple database pods within the Kubernetes deployment, additional customers will consume our new software-as-a-service offering. If we build it, they will come.

The front-end uses Python flask to present both a graphical user interface (GUI) and an application programming interface (API). The GUI uses a blue and pink theme to align with our target demographic. Users can easily add items to their cart and check out in less than one minute. The API uses JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format for its data. Users can also track their orders using voice-activated commands via the GUI. The API response time is typically less than 20 milliseconds, and the GUI plays a "bell" sound once an order has been shipped.

The network that interconnects the application and the users requires high-availability. To achieve this, a leaf/spine architecture has been deployed that creates many alternative paths between any pair of leaves. One spine will be the preferred next-hop for all leaves to maximize throughput across the fabric, while the remaining spines serve as standby next-hops.

Regarding daily operations, the IT management team will monitor both the software application and the underlying network. Past data shows an indirectly proportional correlation between operator notification time and issue manifestation. Said another way, issues are less common when operators pick up the phone sooner.
